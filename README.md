# RISC-V-CPU (RV32I)
Computer Organization and Architecture - EE4243 Project for Fall 2019. Throughout the semester, individual modules of the RISC-V architucture (e.g ALU, PC, Inst. Memory, etc.) were built and towards the end, all modules were joined together to create the CPU. Additionally, the project implemented a special module to calculate floating point addition and subtraction under the IEEE-752 standard for the RISC-V CPU. All instructions used are predetermined/hardcoded in the instruction memory.

*Note: This CPU model does not contain a control unit nor does it contain any pipelining features.
